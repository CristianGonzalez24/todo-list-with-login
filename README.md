# Task Manager App

A **To-Do App** designed to help users keep track of their tasks. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks and saves them until they are completed. The app also features user authentication, so each user can log in and access their personalized task list.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can create new tasks and store them until completion.
- **Edit Tasks:** Tasks can be modified or updated.
- **Delete Tasks:** Completed or unnecessary tasks can be removed.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login system for each user.
- **User Registration:** New users can create an account to manage their own tasks.
- **Personal Task Lists:** Each user's tasks are stored separately and accessed only when logged in.

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** - Database for storing tasks and user data.
- **Express.js** - Backend framework for handling API requests.
- **React.js** - Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
